## Installation

This application requires [Git], [NodeJS] at `v4+` to run. If that is not on your machine, visit the relevant documentation pages to have the technologies installed.

### Initial Setup

If this is the first time setting up the project, follow the steps below.

- Clone the remote repository to your local machine:
  - `git clone bitbucketlinkhere.bitbucketlinkhere`
- Navigate to the newly cloned direcory:
  - `cd Innovate48`
- Install project dependencies found in the _package.json_ file:
  - `npm install` or `npm i`

### Running the Application
